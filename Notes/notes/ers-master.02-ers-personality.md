If the essence of a burned-out fire could take human form, that was Esther: a veil of ashen goth around a fervent core stoked red-hot.

Once a wildfire of a child—untamed and possessed of a fiery, self-destructive energy—Esther is now a smoldering adolescent who radiates searing warmth and firebrand grace, ever-ready to ignite.

At her core, Esther craves adoration—from friends, from family, from community—and sees personal excellence as her pathway to satisfaction.

All spark and motion, Esther dreams big and strides even bigger. Her voracious pursuits include Battles, Coordination, and accolades as an idol-esque performer.

She chases excellence with a zeal that borders on obsession—not just to prove herself, but to earn the spotlight she believes love lives in. Esther does not, will not, beg for attention; rather, believing those who fail to recognize her efforts are in turn unworthy of her energy[^1].

Beneath it all is a girl who fears being overlooked and neglected, whose stubborn pride and insecurity drive her to set goals with ever-increasing grandiosity. A girl who dances of the knife’s edge of failure, ever-defiant of her limits.

[^1]: Desmond is an example of this in singular. She can cut off one-person, but how will this impact her when multiple people reject her? When her community rejects her?
