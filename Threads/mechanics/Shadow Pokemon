Originating from the Orre Region, **Shadow Pokémon** are the result of a mysterious process that strips away their emotions—\_shutting the door to their hearts*—turning them into soulless fighting machines.

Unlike normal Pokémon, which are typically friendly and trusting, Shadow Pokémon attack without hesitation and with ruthless intensity. They may even attack trainers, including their own, in fits of blind rage.

While they appear visually identical to normal Pokémon, certain abilities, tools, or those attuned to aura can detect their corrupted state.

[B][U]Due to the abusive nature of their creation, trainers in possession of Shadow Pokémon will receive intense scrutiny from the Pokémon Protection Agency and may even have their Trainer License revoked.[/U][/B]

[HEADING=2]:zap: Shadow Boost[/HEADING]
Shadow Pokémon emit a sinister aura that enhances their combat capabilities. This is known as the **Shadow Boost**—a permanent _+1 boost to all stats (omni-boost)_ while in their Shadow state.

[B][U]This boost cannot be removed by any means except purification.[/U][/B]
[HEADING=2]:fire: Hyper Mode[/HEADING]
Occasionally, a Shadow Pokémon will be overwhelmed by suppressed emotions, triggering **Hyper Mode**. In this state, for **5 turns**, the Pokémon gains another _omni-boost_, greatly amplifying their power.

[B]This boost also cannot be removed by Haze or similar effects.[/B]

[HEADING=2]:hole: Shadow Moves[/HEADING]
When a Pokémon becomes a Shadow Pokémon, all of its moves are corrupted into **Shadow Moves**. These moves retain their base power and effects.
These moves become **typeless**, losing any **S.T.A.B. (Same Type Attack Bonus)**. In exchange, **they deal super-effective damage to all non-Shadow Pokémon**, regardless of the original move type.

[I]Shadow Moves are infused with a foul, corrupting aura. Repeated exposure is believed to cause severe **aura damage** to normal Pokémon, weakening their connection to their emotions and potentially leaving lasting effects.[/I]
