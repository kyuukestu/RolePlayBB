[HEADING=1]Evolution Stone Grades[/HEADING]
Evolution stones are graded based on the concentration and purity of Type Energy (T.E.) contained within the ore. Each grade represents a bracket of potency and efficacy, influencing not only the evolution process and the resulting state of the evolved Pokémon.

[HEADING=3]Grade One (1) | Supreme Quality[/HEADING]
Purity: 95 - 80%

The pinnacle of evolution stones. Grade One—Supreme Grade Stones—are exceptionally rare and radiate an observable shroud of Type Energy.
Pokémon who evolve with these stones exhibit extraordinary transformations: their cocoons shimmer with intense energy, often up to 50% larger than average, and are accompanied by a visible effluvia of T.E. that lingers.

[HEADING=3]Grade Two (2) | Superior Quality of evolution stone.[/HEADING]
Purity: 79 - 65%

Grade Two stones are highly sought after for their reliable potency. Pokémon evolving with these stones experience robust transformations, with evolution cocoons growing up to 35% larger than average. However, the effluvia of T.E. is minimal, suggesting a more contained release of energy.
The resulting Pokémon are often up to a third larger than their species average and display noticeable improvements in strength and vitality. While not as extraordinary as Grade One evolutions, these transformations are still considered exceptional.

[HEADING=3]Grade Three (3) | Standard Quality[/HEADING]
Purity: 64 - 50%
The most commonly found evolution stones, Grade Three stones provide a reliable, if unremarkable, evolution experience. Pokémon evolving with these stones exhibit standard evolution cocoons and emerge with no significant deviations in size, strength, or ability.
These stones are the backbone of evolution stone trade, offering a consistent and predictable outcomes.

[HEADING=3]Grade Four (4) | Inferior Quality[/HEADING]
Purity: 49 - 35%
Grade Four stones are considered subpar, often resulting in lackluster evolutions. Pokémon evolving with these stones display feeble evolution cocoons, and the resulting transformations are underwhelming. The Pokémon often appear smaller, weaker, or otherwise under-powered compared to their species average.
While evolution is still possible, trainers are advised to avoid these stones unless no other options are available.

[HEADING=3]Grade Five (5) | Impotent Quality[/HEADING]
Purity: Less than 35%
Grade Five stones are functionally inert, containing insufficient Type Energy to trigger evolution. Pokémon exposed to these stones fail to evolve, and the stones themselves are often repurposed for industrial or commercial use.
