[div=letter-spacing: 1px; line-height: 1; white-space: preserve; ]Setting off larger-than-life, breathtaking forms with equal majesty and miniature—the world of Pokémon truly is a world of wonder and awe! A wealth of creatures grace every nook and cranny: they fill the oceans; thrive in the mountains; soar high over the horizons and share sparkling landscapes and cities!

Some are masters of the heavens above; others, caretakers & helpmates of the earth below—watchful eyes and ears throughout recorded history and beyond! Over the years, countless varieties of Pokémon have developed, and researchers have discovered hundreds of different types, but many more are yet to be discovered! Try and count them if you dare, but then—try and count the grains of sand on your favorite beach. We may never truly know their full extent, but one thing is certain—every Pokémon expresses life uniquely!

Today, there are people who collect Pokémon and train hard, striving for their dreams and ambitions. They embark on grand journeys, full of excitement, but full of challenges too. Being a trainer requires dedication and spirit! It is a long and difficult road, but those who travel it oft find friends along the way.

Together humans and Pokémon carry on, facing new challenges and sharing new adventures that will become the tales of tomorrow—but even tomorrow’s stories may have started long ago…

Hello! And welcome to our RP! We're a group of RPers who've recently migrated onto RPNation and are looking to open the doors to some new members!

This RP draws from the extended Poké-Verse. What does that mean? It means we use a combination of canons: Main Series Games, side games, Anime, Manga, etc. Now, among all these canons we use the [div=display: inline; font-weight: bold; font-variant: small-caps; text-decoration: underline; color: green;]Main Series Games[/div] primarily, so we're game-primacy and the events of the main series games are considered to have been historical for the purposes of the RP, and all other canons are used in a supplementary fashion; they provide extensive world-building, locations, technology, etc.

The RP is designed to be a sandbox where characters can explore all the wonders of pokémon and RPers can nerd out over our beloved franchise.[/div]
